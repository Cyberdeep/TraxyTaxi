*What is TraxyTaxi..*

*We all have spend that 5 minutes which extends upto 15 minutes when you call a three wheeler. Whether you call a taxi company or a taxy guy you know at least once we have faced this scenario. And the sad part is while we wait we see a vacant three wheel guy pass buy.*

*Isn't it great if there is a way to cut down that 10-15 minutes time. Wouldn't it be great if there is a way to get a threewheeler right at the moment you step outside of your office, home or after having a meal with your better half ?*

*"TraxyTaxi" is exactly what it's all about. It's super easy to use. Open the app on your phone, locate yourself and you'll see the three wheeler guys who are near your location in an instant. You can easily choose the one closer to you right at that moment. Call the guy just by tapping on the icon. it's SUPER EASY!*
